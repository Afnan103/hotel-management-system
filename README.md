# hotel-management-system

This is a **console-based Hotel Management System** developed in C language.  
The program provides a simple, menu-driven interface that allows hotel staff to:

- Book and cancel room reservations
- Manage customer information
- Display billing details

## 📁 Data Management
The system uses **file handling** to store and retrieve data:
- A file for reservation details
- A separate file for room availability and information

This allows the system to persist data between runs.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Language: C
- File Handling: Standard C I/O (`fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`, etc.)
- Platform: Console (Terminal)

## 📌 How It Works
When the program runs, a text-based menu appears on the screen.  
The user can navigate through different options like:
- Make a reservation
- Cancel a booking
- View room details

All data is read from and saved to external files.
## 🤝 Team Contribution

This project was developed as part of a team of 5 members for the **Programming 1** course.  
It was a collaborative effort that allowed us to apply fundamental programming concepts in C, including file handling, modular coding, and menu-driven logic.  
Each team member contributed to different parts of the system such as reservation logic, customer management, file operations, and user interaction.
